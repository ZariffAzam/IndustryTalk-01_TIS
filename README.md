# IndustryTalk-01_TIS
#### Clarity Techworks 

Ever wondered what its like to work in a startup? Whats your path after graduation? How would AI be implemented in the upcoming years? Clarity Techworks answered all these questions in an online industry talk featuring their founder and CEO as well as a range of employees from different departments like Quality Assurance Analyst, UiUx (User interface and User experience) Designer, Web developer, mobile application developer and many more. 

Here's what i learned from the talk

Work life is full of challenges and setbacks but your attitude in tackling these will determine your success. The talk also provided a much clearer picture of the paths i can take after graduation, introduced the working system inside a corporation and prepared me on what to expect in the upcoming years. 
Much thanks to my group members whom worked together to create a poster on the talk as part of our TIS Assignment01

Thankyou
